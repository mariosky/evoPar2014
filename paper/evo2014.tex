	Using a benchmark problem from the P-Peaks problem generator we compared both approaches: 
	(i) the re-insertion of previous individuals at the cost of keeping copies of each sample, 
	and a common approach of other pool based EAs, (ii) inserting  randomly generated
	individuals. We found that EvoSpace is fault tolerant to highly unreliable resources and
	also that the re-insertion algorithm is only needed when the population is near the point of starvation.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Information technology has become ubiquitous in today's world, sources of 
computing power range from personal computers and smart-devices to massive 
data centers. Users can now access vast computational resources available on 
the Internet using diverse technologies, including cloud computing, 
peer-to-peer (P2P), and http-based environments. This trend can favor 
Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms as these can be designed as parallel, 
distributed, and asynchronous systems.
Several Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) have been proposed that distribute 
the evolutionary process among heterogeneous devices, not only among controlled
nodes in a in-house cluster or grid but also in those out side the data center,
in users' web browsers and smart phones or external cloud based virtual machines.
This reach out approach allows researchers the use of low cost computational 
power that would not be available otherwise, but on the other hand, have the 
challenge to manage heterogeneous unreliable computing resources. Lost 
connections, low bandwidth communications, abandoned work, security and privacy
issues are all common in these settings. 

In this paper the effect of node unavailability in algorithms using the 
EvoSpace population storage is assessed. EvoSpace \cite{Evospace,FreeLunch} is
a framework to develop evolutionary algorithms (EA) using 
heterogeneous and unreliable resources. EvoSpace is based on Linda's tuple
space \cite{Evospace} coordination model, where each node asynchronously
pulls its work from a central shared memory. The core elements of EvoSpace are a central 
repository for the evolving population and remote clients here called EvoWorkers
which pull random samples of the population to perform on them the basic evolutionary
processes (selection, variation and survival), once the work is done, the
modified sample is pushed back to the central population.
This model contrasts with  the use of a global queue of tasks and
implementations of map-reduce algorithms, recently favored in other proposals 
\cite{fazenda2012,di2013towards,FlexGP}.
Following the tuple space model, when individuals are pulled from the EvoSpace
container these are removed from it, so that no other EvoWorker could work on them at same time .
This design decision has several known benefits relevant to concurrency control 
in distributed systems, and also is an effective way of distributing the
workload. Leaving a copy of the individual in the population server free to
be pulled by other EvoWorkers will result in redundant work and this could be
costly if the task at hand is time consuming. EvoWorkers are expected to be 
unreliable, as they can loose a connection or are simply shut down or removed 
from the client. When an EvoWorker is lost, so are the individuals pulled from
the repository. Depending on the type of algorithm been executed, the lost of
these samples could have a high cost. To address the problem of unreliable 
EvoWorkers, EvoSpace uses a simple re-insertion algorithm that also 
prevents the starvation of the population pool. Other pool based algorithms
normally use a random insertion technique, but we argue this could negatively 
impact the outcome of the algorithm in some cases. 

This work evaluates the effect 
of the re-insertion algorithm has on the total running time and number of evaluations 
of a genetic algorithm. Using  a benchmark problem from the P-Peaks 
problem generator, we compare both approaches: (i) the re-insertion previous
individuals at the cost of keeping copies of samples, and (ii) inserting  
randomly generated individuals, with the sometimes beneficial cost of 
adding diversity to the population. For this experiments we use the same
parameters used in an earlier work, in order to compare the 
performance of the algorithm in similar conditions.
EvoSpace was implemented as a web service on the popular Heroku platform 
and EvoWorkers where simulated using PiCloud, a scientific computing PaaS. 

The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section \ref{sec:work} 
reviews related work. Afterwards, Section \ref{sec:evo} briefly describes the
proposed EvoSpace framework and gives implementation details the re-insertion
process. The experimental work is presented in Section \ref{sec:experiments}.
Finally, a summary and concluding remarks are in Section \ref{sec:conclusions}.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:work}
Using available Internet resources for EC has been the focus of recent research
in the field. The use of volunteer computing using BOINC open source software 
is used by Smaoui et al.  \cite{FekiNG09} in this case BOINC uses redundancy
to deal with the volatility of nodes and unreliability of their results. 
In this work each BOINC work unit consisted of a fitness evaluation task and
multiple replicas were produced and sent to different clients, later when 
outputs were received a validation step ensured all outputs match. In case of
a discrepancy or a time-out from a client, a new job replica was created and
sent to another client. The main drawback of this approach was that the 
master-worker algorithm used was synchronous, so the process had to wait 
for all jobs to continue to the next generation. Web browsers were used by 
Merelo et al. \cite{JSON} using Javascript to implement the algorithm, this has the 
advantage of not requiring the installation of additional software. 
In this work the server receives an Ajax request with the best individual 
obtained from the local evolution in clients, and then responds with 
additional parameters and the best individual in the population so far. 
If a client is disconnected no special measures are taken. Several cloud-based
EC solutions are based on a  global queue of tasks and a Map-Reduce 
implementation which normally handles failures by the re-execution of 
tasks \cite{fazenda2012,di2013towards,FlexGP}. 

%% Lo que hice arriba es ir comparando la técnica de failover de cada
%% propuesta me faltan las de abajo 

%This pool-based approach can be traced back to the A-Teams system \cite{ateam}, which is not restricted to evolutionary algorithms.
%Another proposal is made by G. Roy et al. \cite{roy:2009}, who developed a multi-threaded system with a shared memory architecture that is
%executed within a distributed environment and achieves substantial performance gains compared to standard approaches. On the other hand, Bollin and Piastra \cite{bollini:1999} emphasize persistence over performance, proposing a system that decouples population storage from the basic evolutionary operations. A similar decoupled model is proposed by Merelo et al. \cite{merelo:2008}, who used a database to store the population that is accessed through a web-server. The most recent work that is comparable with EvoSpace is the SofEA algorithm proposed by Merelo et al. \cite{sofea1,sofea2}. SofEA is an evolutionary algorithm mapped to a central CouchDB object store. It provides an asynchronous and distributed search process, where the four main evolutionary operators are decoupled from the evolving population.
 
\section{EvoSpace}
\label{sec:evo}
EvoSpace consists of two main components (see figure~\ref{fig:evo}): (i) the EvoSpace 
container that stores the evolving population and (ii) EvoWorkers, which execute 
the actual evolutionary process, while EvoSpace acts only as a population repository.
In a basic configuration, EvoWorkers pull a small random subset of the 
population, and use it as the initial population for a local EA executed 
on the client machine. Afterwards, the evolved population from each EvoWorker 
is returned to the EvoSpace container. When individuals are pulled from the 
container they remain in a phantom state, they cannot be pulled again but 
they are not deleted. Only if and when the EvoWorker returns the replacement 
sample phantoms are truly deleted. If the EvoSpace container is at risk of 
starvation or optionally when a time-out occurs new phantom individuals are 
re-inserted to the population and available again. This can be done because a 
copy of each sample is stored in a priority queue used by EvoSpace to re-insert 
the sample to the central population; similar to games where characters are 
respawned after a certain time. In the experiments conducted in this work 
re-insertion occurs when the population size is below a certain threshold. 
Figure~\ref{fig:evo} illustrates the main components of EvoSpace.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Implementation}
Populations of individuals are stored in-memory, using Redis a key-value database.
Redis was chosen over a relational database system, or other non-SQL 
alternatives, because it provides a hash based implementation of sets 
and queues which are natural data structures for the EvoSpace model. 
The logic of EvoSpace is implemented as a python module and exposed as a web 
service using Cherrypy http library. The EvoSpace modules are available with 
a Simplified BSD License from https://github.com/mariosky/EvoSpace. 

\subsection{Evospace as a Heroku Application}
Heroku is a multi-language PaaS, supporting among others
Ruby, Python and Java applications. The basic unit of composition on
Heroku is a lightweight container running a single user-specified
process. These containers, which they call {\em dynos}, can include web
(only these can receive {\tt http} requests) and worker processes
(including systems used for database and queuing, for instance).
These  process types are the prototypes from which one or more dynos 
can be instantiated; if the number of requests to the server increases
more instances can be assigned on-the-fly. In our case, our CherryPy 
web application server runs in one web process, when the number 
of workers was increased we added more dynos (instances) of the 
CherryPy process.

This model is very different from a VPS where users pay for the
whole server; in a process based model, users pay only for the
processes they need.

Once deployed the web process can be scaled up by assigning more dynos;
in our case and in the more demanding configurations of our experiments, 
the web process was scaled to 20 dynos. Instructions and code for deployment 
is available at \url{http://www.evospace.org/software.html}

\subsection{Evoworkers as PiCloud Jobs}
PiCloud is a Platform as a Service (PaaS), with deep Python integration; 
using a library, Python functions are transparently uploaded to PiCLoud's 
servers as units of computational work they call \emph{jobs}. 
Each job is added to a queue, and when there is a core available, 
the job is assigned to it. Both Heroku and PiCloud 
platforms are deployed  on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS) 
infrastructure in the US-EAST Region. This ensures minimal 
latency and a high bandwidth communication between the services, 
and there is no charge for data transfer costs between both services.
For the experiments type c1 and c2 Real Time workers where used.  
The code for the EvoWorkers implementation and experiment data is publicly available 
from a github repository \url{http://goo.gl/92tMFw}.

\section{Experimental work}
\label{sec:experiments}
\subsection{Benchmark}
\label{ss:benchmark}
The experiment reported here uses a multimodal problem generator. A P-Peaks generator
has been chosen because the problem (and the computing resources needed for the search) 
can be appropriately scaled. Proposed by De Jong et al. in \cite{Jong:PS97} a
P-Peaks instance is created by generating a set of P random N-bit
strings, which represent the location of the P peaks in the space. To
evaluate an arbitrary bit string \begin{math} \mathbf{x} \end{math}
first locate the nearest peak (in Hamming space). Then the fitness of
the bit string is the number of bits the string has in common with
that nearest peak, divided by N. The optimum fitness for an individual
is 1. This particular problem generator is a generalization of the
P-peak problems introduced in \cite{Jong:1990}.            

\begin{equation}
f_{P-PEAKS}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{N} \overset{P}{\max_{i=1}} \{N-hamming(\mathbf{x},Peak_i)   \}
\end{equation}

A large number of peaks induce a time-consuming algorithm,
since evaluating every string is computationally hard; this is
convenient since to evaluate these type of distributed evolutionary
algorithms fitness computation has to be significant with respect to
network latency (otherwise, it would always be faster to have a
single-processor version). However
according to Kennedy and Spears \cite{Kennedy:1998ch} the length of
the string being optimized has a greater effect in determining how
easy or hard is the problem. In their experiments an instance having P
= 200 peaks and N = 100 bits per string is considered to produce a
considerably difficult problem.

\subsection{Experimental Set-up}
As EvoSpace is only the population store, EvoWorkers must implement 
the genetic operators. The genetic algorithm executed by EvoWorkers has been implemented 
using a modified DEAP (Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms in Python) 
framework \cite{DEAP_JMLR2012} GA. Is important to note that only the basic non-distributed GA 
library was used. Three methods were added to the local algorithm: 
{ \tt  getSample()} and  {\tt putBack()}; and  another for the  initialization 
of the population. The implementation of the local GA simply uses DEAP´s methods; for instance to 
generate the initial population, a local {\tt initialize()} is called 
and the population sent to EvoSpace.

The selection of parameters was based on those used in \cite{Alba:2002dq}: a
tournament size of 4 individuals, a crossover rate of 0.85 and a
population of 512 individuals. In  \cite{Jong:PS97} a mutation rate
equal to the reciprocal of the chromosome length; is recommended, as
DEAP uses two parameters they were defined as follows, mutation
probability of 0.5 and an independent flip probability of 0.02. For
EvoWorkers the parameters were 128 worker generations for each
sample, and a sample size of 16. To simulate unreliable workers each worker 
was assigned a return sample probability. In the experiments the lower 
probability was a 30\% chance of an EvoWorker returning a sample or
an EvoWorker failing 70\% of the time; other return sample probabilities
where 50\%, 70\% and 90\%. Experiments where carried out for 4, 
8 and 16 EvoWorkers. In a pool based  asynchronous GAs there is usually no need 
to wait for a worker´s job to start a new generation. Although supported by EvoSpace
time outs were not chosen as triggers to feed the population with new
individuals, the population size was used instead. We believe the population
size is a better threshold as it is more critical to the GA performance. 
In a previous work we found that when the population remaining in the pool 
was near starvation, the time of completion was increased. For these 
experiments, the insertion of individuals was triggered when less than 128
individuals remain in the population; the number of individuals feed to the
population was 128, or 8 samples when the re-insertion algorithm
was used. A summary of the setup is presented in table~\ref{params}.

\subsection{Results}
In this section, results from the experiments are discussed. 
Figure~\ref{fig:plot_time_ri_w4} shows the time required 
to solution when using four EvoWorkers. For a population of
512 individuals and a sample size of 16, there is no
difference in the time required to solution for 
percentages of 50\% and above. Both re-insertion algorithms
had comparable times. For 30 percent, both approaches 
had slight increase in time. For 8 workers 
(see Figure~\ref{fig:plot_time_ri_w8})  there was marginal
decrease in overall time; and results where 
similar to those found in the experiments with 4 workers.  
Figure~\ref{fig:plot_time_ri_w16} shows results for 16 workers,
when there was only a 30\% chance of returning a sample 
the rate of re-insertions was high, approximately once every 35
samples. In this case, the insertion of random individuals 
resulted in a higher time to solution. For these experiments
when there is not a high rate of re-insertion, both alternatives
have similar results, but the re-insertion algorithm is better
for situations when there are many starvation conditions. It appears
that the insertion of random individuals is not detrimental when there
are other evolved individuals in the pool. But when the remaining
pool almost consists of random individuals, samples pulled by
EvoWorkers need to start the search all over again. If then not many
samples are returned to the pool, the work needed to reach an
optimum is increased. Figure~\ref{fig:plot_evals_w16} also shows the number 
of evaluations needed to reach an optimum again for 16 workers.

\section{Conclusions and Further Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

The re-insertion algorithm proposed for EvoSpace is a viable alternative
to deal with a starving population in pool based GAs, and unreliable EvoWorkers.
Using  a benchmark problem from the P-Peaks problem generator, 
the approach was compared against the option of inserting  
randomly generated individuals. The same parameters and computing resources
were used when testing both algorithms with better times reported when
using the proposed technique. For experiments where the population
size is enough for the number of workers with their sample sizes, plus a 
buffer to account for loss samples, then both algorithms could be used.
However for cases when the number of EvoWorkers is unknown an hybrid approach
could be used, insertion of random individuals to gradually increase the population
size, and a re-insertion queue to handle lost samples. Further work could be
focused on a hybrid approach, and also using heterogeneous computing resources.
